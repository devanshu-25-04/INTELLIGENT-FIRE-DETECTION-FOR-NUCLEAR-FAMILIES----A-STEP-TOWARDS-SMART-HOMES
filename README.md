# INTELLIGENT-FIRE-DETECTION-FOR-NUCLEAR-FAMILIES---A-STEP-TOWARS-SMART-HOMES
"Intelligent Fire Alarms for Nuclear Families- A Step Towards Smart Homes" aims to elevate user's safety concerns by keeping the user informed about any changes in the user's house.  The alarm will be installed at the residences, and the user will be contacted or alerted anytime there is smoke or fire of a particular range. 
Basically, we will host our project in Telegram where users may login using their credentials or can register as a new user. We will also create a website on which user can register themselves and then an email will be sent to user everytime any untoward fire/smoke related activity is detected at the user's home. Intelligent Fire Alarm will alert the user who may or may not be far away from the home but it will also alert the residents who are present in the home by creating loud noise, it will then send an alert to Sprinklers present inside the building to start sprinkling water.
With the help of the "Intelligent Fire Alarm" User can take appropriate actions to protect their loved ones from harm. Additionally, a hardware model will also be simulated. Our project uses variety of sensors to sense the changes inside the building. Using the telegram bot user can monitor the changes if they want. The bot will tell the user real time about temperature, humidity, presence of flame and air.
